Exploring and utilizing Computer Network architecture 

## Projects Included:

UDP-Dicovery-Chat:
-UDP discovery using ARP and a UDP broadcast packet scanner.
-UDP Chat program with unicast and able to send broadcast messages, and receive responses. Instructions are displayed on the     screen as you traverse the program. The program follows this general sequence:
    1) Runs arp and puts information in a nice Dataframe
    2) Scans for peers, this may take some time
    3) Prompts the user to set the port of the socket(or use the default at 23432)
    4) prompts user to start a chat(either unicast or broadcast), listen for incoming messages, or just exit the program
